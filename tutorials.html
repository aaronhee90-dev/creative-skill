          <h2> HOW TO DRAW? </h2>
          <p> Some people learn to draw, and some are just naturally good at it. For some people, they would say that they are nothing without reference, and I am one of them. However, we will learn the basics. </p>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/warm-up-scribbles.jpg" alt=image-1> <h2> WARM-UP</h2><p> You should always warm up a little to relax your drawing muscles and get ideas down. So take your pen or pencil out and make various mark. Start scribbling, doodling, creating dots, hatching and making zi-zag lines</p>
           </div>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/warm-up-lines-ellipses.jpg" alt=image-2> <h2> HAND-EYE COORDINATION </h2><p> Let's improve your hand-eye coordination to advance our investigation. Draw a few straight, curved, long and short lines. This is merely a warm-up. These investigations may fill a page. Keep it lighthearted and enjoyable. </p>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/basic-shapes.jpg" alt=image-3><h2> BASIC SHAPES </h2><p> Let's begin drawing properly after our warm-up.  Let's examine the foundation of all drawing abilities.  Basically, anything you wish to design can be broken down into simple shapes.  Triangles, rectangles, and circles are the fundamental shapes that we have already practiced. </p>
           </div>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cosmos-basic-shapes-01.jpg" alt=image-4><h2> CONTINUATION </h2> <p> These simple forms can therefore be used as an informal underdrawing.  For this, we'll begin with very basic shapes and linework, which we can then polish into a more precise structure and well-defined shapes in a later stage. Perfect lines, shadows, and details are not necessary at this point; those can wait. </p>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lots-of-quick-sketches.jpg" alt=image-6><h2> LOOSE QUICK SKETCHES </h2> <p> Let's take a step back before we complete our drawing.  Now you have a rough underdrawing with simple shapes that has been polished with a few defining angles and edges as well as a more solid contour.  That's not too bad. </p>
           </div>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cosmos-finishes-sketch.jpg" alt=image-7> <h2> FOCUS </h2><p> You want to know how to complete your drawing now, don't you?
               You should now make your sketch a little rounder and more rounded.  If you don't have the proper dimensions and basic structure, don't move on to this step; instead, create a new drawing or make corrections to the one you already have.  It's okay to just start over. </p>

               <img src="https://juliabausenhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/baby-animals.jpg" alt=image-8><h2> PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT </h2><p>  The key to getting good at drawing is to practice these skills a lot, over time. You need to get in your pencil miles until this process becomes second nature to you. So practice a lot, and start building your habit by putting a note somewhere so you don’t forget about it. </p>

Gaining knowledge of ideas like perspective, values, light and shadow, foreshortening, and seeing in three-dimensional volumes will significantly improve your abilities and enable you to produce drawings that are well-rounded. </p>
